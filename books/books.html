                <p class="bookDescription">In Post-Truth? Facts and Faithfulness, Jeffrey Dudiak explores the fissures and fractures that vex our so-called “post-truth” era, searching for a deeper, dare we say truer, understanding of the cultural forces that have led North American society to become so polarized. Eschewing the kind of easy responses that trade pluralistic solidarity for tribalistic certainty, Dudiak diagnoses a deeper breakdown in social trust as the underlying issue that has everyone today scurrying for comforting, ideological cover. In this context, Dudiak reminds the reader that truth is more, and runs deeper, than simple correspondence to the facts.</p>

                <p class="bookDescription">In Radicalizing Spirit Jeffrey Dudiak takes on the thorny issue of the relationship between Quakerism and Christianity, an issue that divides the Religious Society of Friends today. Drawing on Quaker history, the Bible, philosophy, and his own experience among Friends, Dudiak advocates thinking the relationship between Quakerism and Christianity in parallel with the relationship that Jesus took up with respect to Judaism, that is, as an attempt at “fulfillment,” which requires both fidelity and transgression. He argues, in short, for Quakerism as a form of Christianity so radical that in it “Christianity” itself is put into perpetual question. Across this suggestion, he invites Friends from across the theological spectrum into a deeper sense of mutual appreciation, more meaningful community, and shared calling. </p>

                    “…every page of this book bears witness to a long and intense familiarity with the work of Levinas. Fine-grained studies focused on specific passages of Levinas’s texts move gradually to a persuasive interpretation of his two masterpieces.”  — John Llewelyn, University of Edinburgh
                    <br><br>
                    “Dudiak displays erudition and sophistication adjudicating in a complex debate between transcendental reflection and empiricism.  He carries off the argument with great success.” —Robert Gibbs, University of Toronto
                    <br><br>
                    “Jeffrey Dudiak has written a learned book on Levinas, rich and revealing in its detailed analysis and interpretation of texts.  But it is also a book with a definite focus and out of a deep conviction.”  — Theodore de Boer, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam
